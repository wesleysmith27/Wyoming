    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
    At <strong>WyomingWes Ventures Inc.</strong>, we are more than just a business, we’re a movement built on ambition, strategy, and unstoppable 67 energy. 
    Our mission is to make insane amounts of money, in insanly scammy and untruthful ways in every market we enter, combining bold vision with flawless execution.
  </p>
    <h2>Our GOAT CEO</h2>
  <p>
    At the heart of it all stands our founder and manager, <strong>Wesley “Wes” Smith</strong> — a true visionary whose drive and discipline inspire everyone around him. 
    Wes was born in one of those hospital things on the upper east side and has lived in battery park since. From grades K-6, he attended P.S/I.S 276 where he learned litterally nothing(see i cant spell bruh) . He then transfered to Avenues where he currently cooks up the academic scene.
  </p>

  <p>
    Known for his sharp financial mind, Wes starting investing at a young age and has since expanded his capital. He also leads the best club in avenues which you should all join: <strong>Avenues Young Investors Society</strong>
    He also likes to build some tuffy keyboards in his free time and likes to play the bass and trombone. 
    Additionally, Wes will cook you in any FPS game available, as the ceo of Wawaworld has found out. 
  </p>

  <p>
    WyomingWes Ventures isn’t just a company — it’s the result of one man’s vision, hard work, and unwavering belief that greatness isn’t given; it’s earned.
